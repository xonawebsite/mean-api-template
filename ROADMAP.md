# Roadmap

These are the things I'd like to add next:
- Storage/uploads management
- Views integrations
- Socket.IO
- Cookie-based session barebones
- MongoDB based session barebones
- Request-limiting middleware
- OAuth implementation (social login)
- Plan/Subscription system
- Paypal + Stripe integration
- CLI helpers (That's the reason for a `/bin` folder, did you noticed?) like models/controllers/
- Scheduled jobs/tasks (ruby-on-rails-like)
